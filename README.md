# dotfiles
This is a repo for testing and playing with dotfiles.
The idea is to test out using github to store custom settings bash/vim/tmux/screen/etc so that I can use them across multiple servers. Ideally without needing to make any permanent changes.

Usage:
git clone https://github.com/Hborr/dotfiles.git /tmp/"${USER}"dotfiles ; source /tmp/$"{USER}"dotfiles/temp.bashrc
